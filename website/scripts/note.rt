Use api at /api/0/[POST or GET]/[data if fetching/adding tickets] - response will be json 
Use POST/login for login - data sent should contain username and sha256 hashed password, and for future reference some diagnostic data -- not important though. 
                                                    could be hashed too btw but use a key for that, eg a caesar cypher or smn.
future goals will include salting hashes.

refer to /frontend/endpoints.map for all available endpoints.
